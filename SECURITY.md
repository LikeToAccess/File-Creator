## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please submit an issue with the vulnerability tag explaining all
the necessary information


Current vulnerabilities will not be shown, and therefore duplicate issues
will be manually declined by a developer. Once a vulnerability is fixed the
the issue report will be made public and marked as fixed.

If your vulnerability is declined it was either because it was not a valid report,
not an actual issue, or was a duplicate. If your submission is not declined within
one business day assume it was accepted unless otherwise specified.
